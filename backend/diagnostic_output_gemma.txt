SUCCESS: gemma-3-4b-it responded: Okay! I see you've sent a "Test." 

I'm here and ready. Do you want me to:

*   **Respond to you?** (Just say something!)
*   **Perform a specific task?** (Like write a poem, answer a question, or summarize something?)
*   **Just confirm that I'm working?** (I'm responding!)

--- Testing Model: gemma-3-1b-it ---
SUCCESS: gemma-3-1b-it responded: Okay, I see you've just typed "Test". 

Is there anything specific you'd like me to do? For example, are you:

*   **Testing a function?** (If so, please tell me what the function does!)
*   **Just testing the connection?** (I'm functioning as expected.)
*   **Something else entirely?** 

Let me know! 😊

This confirms I'm receiving and processing your input. 😊 

Do you want to test something specific? Let me know what you'd like me to do! For example:

*   **Ask me a question:** "What is the capital of France?"
